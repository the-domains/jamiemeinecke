About Me

I could write paragraphs of touching, pretty words about life goals and generic junk about why I am perfect for what ever job I've applied to. But what would be the point? You've heard that a thousand times. So here's what's important:

I like taking stuff apart, figure out how it works and then develop a way to make it work better

I believe functionality is the foundation of intelligent design

I get stuff done

I turn mistakes into wins

&

I love the hell out of it.
